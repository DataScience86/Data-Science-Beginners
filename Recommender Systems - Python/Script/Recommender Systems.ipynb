    "# Why build recommender systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems are built in order to find out the items that a user is most likely to purchase or show interest in. Almost all the ecommerce websites these days use recommender systems to make product recommendation at their site. For example, Netflix uses it to make movie recommendations. If you use Amazon music then you must have seen the music recommendations which may have helped you in finding new music. Companies like Facebook, linkedIn, or other social media platforms also use recommnder systems to help you connect with new people. "

    "# Different approaches to recommender systems\n",
    "\n",
    "To build recommender systems we use the following techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaborative filtering** - They are also called as crowdsource models. As it is based on what items most user prefer over certain others items. Collaborative filtering further have two approaches - \n",
    "\n",
    "    a. **User based** - These systems make recommendations based upon the similarity between the users. The similarity could be defined based upon infromations like age, martial status, net worth, geographical location, places you visit, number of children you have, etc. Let say a user who is 34, married and have two children was offered a credit card and he accepted that offer. Then the next customer who is also married and has children will be made the same offer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. **Item based** - Item based systems are also called as item-to-item systems. They generate recommendations based on ratings given by user to the similar items. Think of this as the recommendations given to you by ecommerce websites stating people who purchased this also purchased A, B, and C items. For example, User X and Y have given high rating to a mobile phone and the charger from from brand XX. Then you purchased the same Mobile phone and gave high rating to the phone. Now based upon the similarity of preference between user X and Y and that you also liked the phone, system will make a recommendation for charger to you as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Popularity based Systems** - These sytems can be thought as the elementary form of collaborative filtering. The items are recommended based upon how popular those items are among other buyers or users. For example, a restaurant may be recommended to you because it has been rated high or has received most number of positive reviews by the users. So these systems require a historical data in order to make a suggestion. They are mostly, used by websites like Forbes, bloomber, or other news sites. Note - These systems cannot make personalized recommendations as they do not take into account the user infomration.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Content Based Systems** - These recommenders recommend items or products based upon the feature similarity of products. For example, if you have given high rate to the hotel facing beach then similar hotels will be recommened to you.\n"

We can also check what cuisine the top 9 restaurants serve by using the below code. I want to point out here is that you should also check how many people gave the rating to the restaurants. There are fare chances that only one person gave rating to both the restaurant. This can result into high pearson correlation value of one. But this is not meaningful. The places must have more than one review in order to represent meaningful correlation. \n",

    "Classification based algorithm are powered by machine learning algorithms like navie bayes, logistic regression, etc. These models are capable of making personalized recommendations, because they take into account purchase history, user attributes, as well as other contextual data. In our example, we will use logistic regression model to build the recommendation system which will help a sales representative to a call on whether to reach a client with product recommendation or not. Basically, the model will predict whether the customer will buy the product or not. This demo is an example of user based recommendation system."
